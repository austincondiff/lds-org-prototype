She is looking forward to the possibility to Skype in on a lesson. \"It would be a lot more personal,\" she said. \"He would have a better connection to it because I would be there.\"</p>\n<p>Sister Plowman and her companion also have received a referral through the new process. \"This way, you know that if [the referral is] sent by someone, then there might be more potential. And you have a way to contact someone as a point of reference. Something else that I think is really helpful is that if that person lives in that area who contacted you, they could come with you,\" she said.</p>\n<p>While working as a door-to-door salesman in San Diego, California, Dallin Pancheri met a woman named Erlinda. When she found out he had learned Spanish from serving mission in Colombia, their discussion led to the gospel and he offered to send some representatives from the Church who could talk more with her.</p>\n<p>As Dallin pulled up the LDS Tools app on his phone to locate a nearby LDS meetinghouse, he discovered he could submit a referral right from the app. He did so, and when the missionaries contacted him later, Dallin explained to them how he met Erlinda.</p>\n<p>\"The Spirit definitely touched me, and it was a nice little reminder of how great the missionary effort is,\" he said. \"It's nice to know that the Church is coming up with ways to make it easier to spread the word and really allow every ear to hear the word of Christ and the message of the restored gospel,\" he said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lds.org/referrals/?lang=eng\">LDS.org/referrals</a> is available in 32 languages.
