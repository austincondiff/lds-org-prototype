{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The First Presidency announced in a <a href=\"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/06/20/15790_000_letter.pdf?lang=eng\">letter</a> dated June 20 new guidelines for interviewing youth. In addition, the Church's official handbook of instructions has been updated.</p>\n<p>\"Bishops have a sacred responsibility to lead, teach, and inspire youth,\" according to a letter signed by the First Presidency and sent to general and local Church leaders.</p>\n<p>\"Effective personal interviews are one important way they do this. These interviews provide opportunities to help youth become disciples of the Savior, repent of transgressions, and live the gospel of Jesus Christ.\"</p>\n<p>Leaders who conduct interviews with youth should \"prepare themselves spiritually to be guided by the Holy Ghost\" and are encouraged \"to carefully review the guidelines for interviews and counseling,\" according to the letter.</p>\n<p>To help ensure that youth and parents are aware of the topics and questions covered in these interviews, bishops are instructed to share the updated guidelines with families before the first interview.</p>\n<p>The new guidelines will appear in Handbook 1, the policy guide for Latter-day Saint bishops and stake presidents. The chapter \"Guidelines for Youth Interviews\" will be updated in online resources for leaders, according to the letter.</p>\n<p>The guidelines apply to interviews with youth 12 and older. \"Generally, children younger than 11 are not interviewed except in preparation for baptism or to be sealed to their parents in the temple. These interviews are different in nature from youth interviews, and parents are typically present,\" according to the letter.</p>\n<p>According to the updates in <em>Handbook 1:</em> \"Parents have the primary responsibility for teaching their children the gospel of Jesus Christ. They help their children grow spiritually and prepare to make and keep sacred covenants. Parents also counsel with their children regarding worthiness and help them repent and improve. Bishops and other Church leaders support parents in these efforts,\" according to the Church's <em>Handbook 1</em>.</p>\n<p>The handbook instructs bishops to share with youth and parents the following information about interviews:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parents have the primary responsibility to teach and nurture their children.</li>\n<li>Typically, the bishop or one of his counselors will interview the young man or young woman at least twice a year for the reasons outlined in \"Purposes of Interviews\" below. A bishopric member may also meet with youth to answer questions, give support, or extend assignments.</li>\n<li>To help youth prepare spiritually, interviews are required for sacred matters such as temple recommends, priesthood ordinations, and mission calls. Leaders work with parents to help youth prepare for these interviews.</li>\n<li>Parents encourage their children to meet with the bishop when they need his help with spiritual guidance or with repentance.</li>\n<li>If a youth desires, he or she may invite a parent or another adult to be present when meeting with the bishop or one of his counselors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Key matters for discussion during these interviews \"include the growth of the young person's testimony of Heavenly Father, the mission and Atonement of Jesus Christ, and the restored gospel.\"</p>\n<p>The bishop and his counselors \"emphasize the importance of keeping baptismal covenants. They teach youth to prepare to make and keep temple covenants through daily righteous living. Bishopric members encourage youth to pray regularly in private and with their family and to study the scriptures. They also encourage youth to stay close to their parents.\"</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First Presidency Releases New Guidelines for Interviewing Youth","subtitle":"New guidelines for interviewing youth and handbook of instructions have been updated","date":"June 15, 2018","path":"/news/new-guidelines-for-interviewing-youth","category":"First Presidency Letter","tags":["Church Leaders","Youth"],"excerpt":"Interviews provide opportunities to help youth become disciples of the Savior, repent of transgressions, and live the gospel of Jesus Christ.","image":"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/06/20/580-1560412-PS091115_cah_0073.jpg","contributor":"janedoe","video":null}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"totalCount":16,"edges":[{"node":{"id":"c898688b-aa2f-570d-8777-635831469d4b","frontmatter":{"title":"His Power to Heal and Forgive","subtitle":"Jesus Forgives Sins and Heals a Man Stricken with Palsy","date":"June 19, 2018","path":"/news/his-power-to-heal-and-forgive","category":"Bible Videos","tags":["New Products","Music and Arts"],"excerpt":"Jesus shows that He has power to both forgive sins and heal physical infirmities.

That was the moment I became a dad.</p>\n<p>I felt overwhelmed with the responsibility before me. It was an emotional moment for everyone there. I will forever be grateful for the sincere love, trust, and confidence of our daughter's birth mother in us. She knew that we would give our child everything we possibly could.</p>\n<p>I'm now the father of three beautiful girls. When people find out that the oldest two are adopted, there's a common question that follows almost like clockwork. The conversation goes something like this:</p>\n<p>Them: \"I didn't know two of your girls are adopted---that's so cool.\"</p>\n<p>Me: \"Thanks! Yeah, it's awesome. We feel like the luckiest parents in the world.\"</p>\n<p>Them: \"So, how much do they know about their real dad?\"</p>\n<p>Each time, I can't help but think, \"Wait, what? Real dad?!\" I'm their dad and I'm plenty real.</p>\n<p>But don't worry, I'm not offended. I know what they mean---they mean birth father. And it's okay, I'm super secure in my dad-hood. I'm a father and have the dad jokes and dad bod to prove it.</p>\n<p>When we put our two oldest to bed and it's story time, I love to tell them what an incredible gift adoption has been for us. I tell them about the special club they belong to---the amazing adoption club.</p>\n<p>\"Who else is adopted? Who else is in your club?\" I'll ask.</p>\n<p>\"Superman!\" My four-year-old will start.</p>\n<p>\"That's right. Who else?\"</p>\n<p>\"Batman, Spider-Man, and Ironman,\" my seven-year-old will add.</p>\n<p>\"Yep. Pretty much all the coolest superheroes---and who else was adopted who is even more super than them?\"</p>\n<p>\"Jesus,\" they'll say together.</p>\n<p>\"That's right,\" I'll say. \"Jesus was adopted by Joseph, and His story is true.\"</p>\n<p>When I talk with my girls, I often reflect on Joseph's role as an adoptive father. I have always admired and aspired to be like Joseph. He was the man Heavenly Father entrusted to care for, love, protect, and teach Jesus. As the Savior grew, Joseph taught Him and shared with Him all he knew. Joseph was an example. He was a loyal and loving husband to Jesus's earthly mother. Amidst the judgment of his peers, he was a faithful fiancé, and he trusted and obeyed God.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/blog/bc/images/jesus-and-joseph-183351.jpg\"></p>\n<p>I imagine Joseph felt overwhelmed but that he also felt the love, trust, and confidence of Heavenly Parents as he accepted the solemn responsibility of being the earthly father of the Savior of the world. He was a real father in every way that I am a \"real dad.\"</p>\n<p>Or was he? And am I really?</p>\n<p>Sometimes when I get asked \"So, how much do they know about their real dad?\" I'm hit with the unintended but far more important meaning of that question. Because no matter how many diapers I've changed and skinned knees I've kissed and sleepless nights I've spent worrying about my children, they are not really mine. They are, and will always be, children of God first.</p>\n<p>If I do my job as a father right, I should be able to answer the question I so often get with confidence: \"They know a lot about Him. They pray to Him. They know that He loves them and has a plan for them and wants them to come home to live with Him again one day.\"</p>\n<p>So, welcome to the club---the amazing adoption club.</p>\n<p>You are adopted. You are a literal son or daughter of Heavenly Parents. They love you more than you can understand and want you to come back home to Them when your work here is done.</p>\n<p>And what makes a dad a real dad? It's not just making corny jokes, telling embarrassing stories, or even sharing the same DNA. It's being an example. It's teaching your children who they are and whose they are.</p>\n<p>I'm grateful for the opportunity I have to be a dad to three of Heavenly Father's children, and I'm trying my very best to be a real dad. As I work every day to love and teach my children, I'm being a real dad. And you know what? I'm okay with a small \"r\" on that word. I'll reserve the capital \"R\" for their Real Father---their Heavenly Father.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Derek Westra is a husband to one, father to three, and self-proclaimed donut enthusiast to hundreds.
