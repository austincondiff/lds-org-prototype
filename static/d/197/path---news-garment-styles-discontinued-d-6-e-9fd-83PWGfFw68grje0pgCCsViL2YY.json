Kimball announced that the opportunity to receive all the blessings of the priesthood would be extended to all of God's children everywhere in the world. The revelation rescinded the restriction on priesthood ordination. It also extended the blessings of the temple to all worthy Latter-day Saints, men and women (see <a href=\"https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/2?lang=eng\">Official Declaration 2</a>).</p>\n<p>While the June celebration will hail the history of black Mormon pioneers and reaffirm the reality that \"all are alike unto God\" (<a href=\"https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33?lang=eng#32\">2 Nephi 26:33</a>) in His global family, the event is intended to be much more than a celebration. It will also be a renewal of our collective commitment to pursue oneness in our relationships with each other and with heaven.</p>\n<p>Although attitudes and choices such as anger, bigotry, racism, prejudice, and intolerance cause separation and division, fortunately, prophets have taught that \"a great day of unity is coming\" (\"<a href=\"https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one?lang=eng\">Our Hearts Knit as One</a>,\" Oct. 2008 general conference).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/05/02/620-london-nairobi-demonstrate-different-face-of-lds-church-duri_20.jpg\"></p>\n<p>President Russell M.
