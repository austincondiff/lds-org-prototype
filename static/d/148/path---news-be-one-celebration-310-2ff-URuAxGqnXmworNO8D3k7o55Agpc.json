Once you obtain your friend's permission to be contacted, no matter where you and your friend live---even if you're far apart---when you submit a name to the missionaries, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be part of the process by helping the missionaries understand your friend's needs, interests, questions, and preferred method of communication. After submitting your friend's contact information, you will see contact information for the missionaries, bishop, and ward mission leader where your friend lives.</li>\n<li>Participate in missionary lessons or gospel discussions in person or through phone or video chat. You can be as involved in teaching your friend as you want to be.</li>\n<li>Follow up with your friend between missionary appointments to answer questions and provide support.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Watch the video on <a href=\"https://www.lds.org/referrals/?lang=eng\">lds.org/referrals</a> called \"<a href=\"https://www.lds.org/referrals/?lang=eng\">Share the Gospel with a Friend</a>\" to see more about this approach with members and missionaries working together.</p>\n<p>While serving as a missionary in the Oregon Salem Mission, Sister Carly Plowman from Thornton, Colorado, realized how important it is to share the gospel with her own family and decided to use the referral system to send the missionaries to her grandfather.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/01/29/620-referral%20image%201%20copy.png#outsetRight\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/01/29/620referral%20image%202%20copy.png#outsetRight\"></p>\n<p>She heard back from the missionaries quickly, and her grandfather has been taught the Restoration lesson. She is looking forward to the possibility to Skype in on a lesson. \"It would be a lot more personal,\" she said. \"He would have a better connection to it because I would be there.\"</p>\n<p>Sister Plowman and her companion also have received a referral through the new process. \"This way, you know that if [the referral is] sent by someone, then there might be more potential. And you have a way to contact someone as a point of reference. Something else that I think is really helpful is that if that person lives in that area who contacted you, they could come with you,\" she said.</p>\n<p>While working as a door-to-door salesman in San Diego, California, Dallin Pancheri met a woman named Erlinda. When she found out he had learned Spanish from serving mission in Colombia, their discussion led to the gospel and he offered to send some representatives from the Church who could talk more with her.</p>\n<p>As Dallin pulled up the LDS Tools app on his phone to locate a nearby LDS meetinghouse, he discovered he could submit a referral right from the app. He did so, and when the missionaries contacted him later, Dallin explained to them how he met Erlinda.</p>\n<p>\"The Spirit definitely touched me, and it was a nice little reminder of how great the missionary effort is,\" he said. \"It's nice to know that the Church is coming up with ways to make it easier to spread the word and really allow every ear to hear the word of Christ and the message of the restored gospel,\" he said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lds.org/referrals/?lang=eng\">LDS.org/referrals</a> is available in 32 languages.

That was the moment I became a dad.</p>\n<p>I felt overwhelmed with the responsibility before me. It was an emotional moment for everyone there. I will forever be grateful for the sincere love, trust, and confidence of our daughter's birth mother in us. She knew that we would give our child everything we possibly could.</p>\n<p>I'm now the father of three beautiful girls. When people find out that the oldest two are adopted, there's a common question that follows almost like clockwork. The conversation goes something like this:</p>\n<p>Them: \"I didn't know two of your girls are adopted---that's so cool.\"</p>\n<p>Me: \"Thanks! Yeah, it's awesome. We feel like the luckiest parents in the world.\"</p>\n<p>Them: \"So, how much do they know about their real dad?\"</p>\n<p>Each time, I can't help but think, \"Wait, what? Real dad?!\" I'm their dad and I'm plenty real.</p>\n<p>But don't worry, I'm not offended. I know what they mean---they mean birth father. And it's okay, I'm super secure in my dad-hood. I'm a father and have the dad jokes and dad bod to prove it.</p>\n<p>When we put our two oldest to bed and it's story time, I love to tell them what an incredible gift adoption has been for us. I tell them about the special club they belong to---the amazing adoption club.</p>\n<p>\"Who else is adopted? Who else is in your club?\" I'll ask.</p>\n<p>\"Superman!\" My four-year-old will start.</p>\n<p>\"That's right. Who else?\"</p>\n<p>\"Batman, Spider-Man, and Ironman,\" my seven-year-old will add.</p>\n<p>\"Yep. Pretty much all the coolest superheroes---and who else was adopted who is even more super than them?\"</p>\n<p>\"Jesus,\" they'll say together.</p>\n<p>\"That's right,\" I'll say. \"Jesus was adopted by Joseph, and His story is true.\"</p>\n<p>When I talk with my girls, I often reflect on Joseph's role as an adoptive father. I have always admired and aspired to be like Joseph. He was the man Heavenly Father entrusted to care for, love, protect, and teach Jesus. As the Savior grew, Joseph taught Him and shared with Him all he knew. Joseph was an example. He was a loyal and loving husband to Jesus's earthly mother. Amidst the judgment of his peers, he was a faithful fiancé, and he trusted and obeyed God.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/blog/bc/images/jesus-and-joseph-183351.jpg\"></p>\n<p>I imagine Joseph felt overwhelmed but that he also felt the love, trust, and confidence of Heavenly Parents as he accepted the solemn responsibility of being the earthly father of the Savior of the world. He was a real father in every way that I am a \"real dad.\"</p>\n<p>Or was he? And am I really?</p>\n<p>Sometimes when I get asked \"So, how much do they know about their real dad?\" I'm hit with the unintended but far more important meaning of that question. Because no matter how many diapers I've changed and skinned knees I've kissed and sleepless nights I've spent worrying about my children, they are not really mine. They are, and will always be, children of God first.</p>\n<p>If I do my job as a father right, I should be able to answer the question I so often get with confidence: \"They know a lot about Him. They pray to Him. They know that He loves them and has a plan for them and wants them to come home to live with Him again one day.\"</p>\n<p>So, welcome to the club---the amazing adoption club.</p>\n<p>You are adopted. You are a literal son or daughter of Heavenly Parents. They love you more than you can understand and want you to come back home to Them when your work here is done.</p>\n<p>And what makes a dad a real dad? It's not just making corny jokes, telling embarrassing stories, or even sharing the same DNA. It's being an example. It's teaching your children who they are and whose they are.</p>\n<p>I'm grateful for the opportunity I have to be a dad to three of Heavenly Father's children, and I'm trying my very best to be a real dad. As I work every day to love and teach my children, I'm being a real dad. And you know what? I'm okay with a small \"r\" on that word. I'll reserve the capital \"R\" for their Real Father---their Heavenly Father.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Derek Westra is a husband to one, father to three, and self-proclaimed donut enthusiast to hundreds.
