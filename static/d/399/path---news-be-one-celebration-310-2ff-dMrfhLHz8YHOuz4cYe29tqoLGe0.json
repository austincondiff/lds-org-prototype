Kimball announced that the opportunity to receive all the blessings of the priesthood would be extended to all of God's children everywhere in the world. The revelation rescinded the restriction on priesthood ordination. It also extended the blessings of the temple to all worthy Latter-day Saints, men and women (see <a href=\"https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/2?lang=eng\">Official Declaration 2</a>).</p>\n<p>While the June celebration will hail the history of black Mormon pioneers and reaffirm the reality that \"all are alike unto God\" (<a href=\"https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33?lang=eng#32\">2 Nephi 26:33</a>) in His global family, the event is intended to be much more than a celebration. It will also be a renewal of our collective commitment to pursue oneness in our relationships with each other and with heaven.</p>\n<p>Although attitudes and choices such as anger, bigotry, racism, prejudice, and intolerance cause separation and division, fortunately, prophets have taught that \"a great day of unity is coming\" (\"<a href=\"https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one?lang=eng\">Our Hearts Knit as One</a>,\" Oct. 2008 general conference).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/05/02/620-london-nairobi-demonstrate-different-face-of-lds-church-duri_20.jpg\"></p>\n<p>President Russell M.

Snow collected the first set of songs for children in 1880, published two years after the founding of the Primary Mutual Improvement Association. <em>The Children Sing,</em> published in 1951, known affectionately by members as \"the blue book,\" includes 199 songs divided into seven sections. Delicate pastel illustrations accompany the 268 songs in the currently used <em>Children's Songbook,</em> first published in 1989 in 21 languages, which compiled favorite resources from previous songbooks like <em>Sing with Me, More Songs for Children,</em> and <em>Activity Songs and Verses.</em></p>","id":"a29ab7fc-1c4a-5dbd-ad27-07851bb61b92","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-06-18T12:34:00+00:00","path":"/news/church-announces-plans-for-new-hymnbook-and-childrens-songbook","title":"Church Announces Plans for New Hymnbook and Children’s Songbook","excerpt":"Sacred music teaches the doctrines of the gospel, nourishes us spiritually, and has the power to unify Church members throughout the world.
