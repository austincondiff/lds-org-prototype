Marianne Jennings, LDS Media Library product manager, explained the differences between the Church's apps: \"The Gospel Library app is a personal study tool. The Mormon Channel app is for inspiration. The LDS Media Library app is a media presentation and teaching tool.\"</p>\n<p>Whether you're in charge of a Sunday School lesson, a family home evening, or a missionary discussion, you now have the most comprehensive database of Church media at your fingertips.</p>\n<p>Browse and search</p>\n<p>When users first open LDS Media Library 2.0, they are guided through a quick walk-through of the purpose of the app and some of its highlights.</p>\n<p>Because the Church frequently releases new media, it can be hard to keep up with all the latest material. With LDS Media Library 2.0, you can stay up to date with newly added items. \"Every Friday, we add new media to the app,\" Jennings said.</p>\n<p>The Browse tab allows users to explore the largest selection of Church media, sorted into three collections: images, music, and video. Simply tap on one of the categories and you'll be directed to a list of topics and collections that simplify how you plan lessons. You can also conduct a quick search by title, topic, or speaker. Images can now be viewed full screen while browsing.</p>\n<p>\"Teachers can easily find lesson media, especially the general conference messages for third-hour lessons,\" Jennings said.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"md-figure\"><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/04/03/350Create2.jpg#outsetLeft\"><figcaption>'The LDS Media Library app stands apart from other apps with the largest selection of Church media.'</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>My Media</h3>\n<p>You can easily arrange, trim, and delete videos or music within your media presentation.</p>\n<p>Under the My Media tab, members can create media presentations, sort and manage their downloaded media, and refer back to favorites.</p>\n<p>\"We've changed the word 'playlist' to 'presentation' so people can understand that the app is a presentation tool ... like a PowerPoint or a Keynote with media---not a Pandora or a Spotify sort of app,\" Jennings clarified.</p>\n<p>The improved app also separates two actions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download</li>\n<li>Add to Presentation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you want to download a single item, you can do so, and it will save in its own tab. As you're creating a presentation, you can add media while searching or browsing, or go to the Downloads tabs, select the appropriate items, and tap \"Add to Presentation.\"</p>\n<p>If you don't want to present an entire 15-minute general conference talk, you can easily trim sections of the media, which will conveniently autosave. \"If you want to show just the two-minute quote from a conference talk that goes right with your lesson, you can do that. Using sliders, you can control when the video or audio clip starts and stops,\" said Jennings. From there, you can easily drag and drop clips in the order you want to present them.\n<img src=\"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/04/03/350Create3.jpg#left\"></p>\n<p>Not ready to download a clip yet? You can tap a small heart icon by the media you're considering, and it will automatically save into a Favorites tab for future reference.</p>\n<p>In the first release of the app, users could only use presentation mode when they were connected to a second screen, like a projector or TV. Now, you can present full-screen presentations on your phone, tablet, or computer.</p>\n<p>\"We have a lot of missionaries using the app, and they only have their tablets or smartphones,\" Jennings said. \"Now they can build media presentations right into the app, hit the presentation icon, and it goes full screen. They can now swipe through their slides too. It's kind of like the old-fashioned flip charts, except it's digital and they can customize it.\"</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/04/03/350Create4.jpg#right\"></p>\n<h3>User friendly</h3>\n<p>The app tells you how much storage space each video or music clip will take up on your device.</p>\n<p>All of the updates for LDS Media Library 2.0 are geared for a more user-friendly experience.</p>\n<p>Because presentations play offline, you won't have to worry about buffering videos. Download your media at home, and you'll be ready to go by the time you get to church. Your video will play without interruption, regardless of the Church building's Wi-Fi connection, or a lack thereof.</p>\n<p>Users can access LDS Media Library 2.0 in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Jennings said more languages are planned for a future release, especially for creating language captions in videos.</p>\n<p>The 2.0 software update offers media in smaller file sizes to save users' storage on their device. \"When you download media, the app tells you how much storage is taken up by that media. You can delete the download but keep the presentation for future use if you don't want an old presentation taking up space,\" Jennings said.</p>\n<p>Even though the files are smaller than before, the app's production team has ensured that media quality remains high. That way, videos will display clear resolution on both small and large screens.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/04/03/350Create5.jpg#outsetLeft\"></p>\n<h3>Watch for more updates</h3>\n<p>Not ready to download a video or music item yet? Tap the heart icon and it will save to your Favorites tab for later.</p>\n<p>The production team for LDS Media Library anticipates more updates this year, based in part on user feedback. Jennings commented on planned improvements:</p>\n<p>\"Videos will soon have the ability to turn on and view captions. We're adding the ability to add text slides, so members can add text to their presentation,\" she explained. \"If you've got personal music, images, or videos on your phone or tablet that you want to add to your presentation, you'll be able to do that. That means that if teachers want to show a video of a Mutual event or fireside to further personalize the presentation, they can,\" she said.</p>\n<p>LDS Media Library provides a <a href=\"https://www.lds.org/pages/mobileapps/media-library-app-2.0?lang=eng#training\">downloadable presentation and handout</a> on the app's landing page for teacher training. \"We have a how-to presentation about [LDS Media Library 2.0] that teachers can download and present to other teachers on how to use the app,\" Jennings said.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/04/03/350Create6.jpg#outsetRight\"></p>\n<p>With a quick search of any topic, you can browse media in a number of categories, including videos, images, and music.</p>\n<p>Under Settings, users can submit feedback, read a user guide, and browse frequently asked questions. Jennings encourages users to submit their feedback, including videos they'd like added and languages they would like the app in.</p>\n<p>If users have issues while using the app, they can now take a screenshot of their problem and send it to the production team for assistance.</p>\n<p>Tell us what you think about the new app by emailing <a href=\"mailto:ldsmedialibrary@ldschurch.org\">ldsmedialibrary@ldschurch.org</a>.</p>\n<p>You can download the app for both Android and Apple mobile devices and learn more about its exclusive features <a href=\"https://www.lds.org/pages/mobileapps/media-library-app?lang=eng\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/04/03/620Create1.jpg#center\"></p>\n<p>If you don't want to present an entire video or song, you can easily trim sections of the media, which will conveniently autosave.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/04/03/620Create7.jpg#outsetCenter\"></p>\n<p>The updated software allows you to easily arrange videos in your presentation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/04/03/620Create8.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Missionaries with tablets and smartphones can create personalized lessons for those they teach. \"It's kind of like the old-fashioned flip charts, except it's digital and they can customize it,\" said Marianne Jennings.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/04/03/620Create9.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Engage class members with up-to-date media content.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Create Powerful, Visual Presentations with the Church’s Updated Media Library App","subtitle":"The church has updated the Media Library app","date":"June 10, 2018","path":"/news/updated-media-library-app","category":"Announcement","tags":["New Products","Technology","Education"],"excerpt":"Whether you’re in charge of a Sunday School lesson, a family home evening, or a missionary discussion, with the LDS Media Library app you have an updated, comprehensive database of Church media at your fingertips.","image":"https://www.lds.org/bc/content/ldsorg/church/news/2018/04/03/580Create.jpg","contributor":"janedoe","video":null}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"totalCount":16,"edges":[{"node":{"id":"661c6220-3990-52e7-affb-f03ee8487e68","frontmatter":{"title":"His Power to Heal and Forgive","subtitle":"Jesus Forgives Sins and Heals a Man Stricken with Palsy","date":"June 19, 2018","path":"/news/his-power-to-heal-and-forgive","category":"Bible Videos","tags":["New Products","Music and Arts"],"excerpt":"Jesus shows that He has power to both forgive sins and heal physical infirmities.

That was the moment I became a dad.</p>\n<p>I felt overwhelmed with the responsibility before me. It was an emotional moment for everyone there. I will forever be grateful for the sincere love, trust, and confidence of our daughter's birth mother in us. She knew that we would give our child everything we possibly could.</p>\n<p>I'm now the father of three beautiful girls. When people find out that the oldest two are adopted, there's a common question that follows almost like clockwork. The conversation goes something like this:</p>\n<p>Them: \"I didn't know two of your girls are adopted---that's so cool.\"</p>\n<p>Me: \"Thanks! Yeah, it's awesome. We feel like the luckiest parents in the world.\"</p>\n<p>Them: \"So, how much do they know about their real dad?\"</p>\n<p>Each time, I can't help but think, \"Wait, what? Real dad?!\" I'm their dad and I'm plenty real.</p>\n<p>But don't worry, I'm not offended. I know what they mean---they mean birth father. And it's okay, I'm super secure in my dad-hood. I'm a father and have the dad jokes and dad bod to prove it.</p>\n<p>When we put our two oldest to bed and it's story time, I love to tell them what an incredible gift adoption has been for us. I tell them about the special club they belong to---the amazing adoption club.</p>\n<p>\"Who else is adopted? Who else is in your club?\" I'll ask.</p>\n<p>\"Superman!\" My four-year-old will start.</p>\n<p>\"That's right. Who else?\"</p>\n<p>\"Batman, Spider-Man, and Ironman,\" my seven-year-old will add.</p>\n<p>\"Yep. Pretty much all the coolest superheroes---and who else was adopted who is even more super than them?\"</p>\n<p>\"Jesus,\" they'll say together.</p>\n<p>\"That's right,\" I'll say. \"Jesus was adopted by Joseph, and His story is true.\"</p>\n<p>When I talk with my girls, I often reflect on Joseph's role as an adoptive father. I have always admired and aspired to be like Joseph. He was the man Heavenly Father entrusted to care for, love, protect, and teach Jesus. As the Savior grew, Joseph taught Him and shared with Him all he knew. Joseph was an example. He was a loyal and loving husband to Jesus's earthly mother. Amidst the judgment of his peers, he was a faithful fiancé, and he trusted and obeyed God.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.lds.org/blog/bc/images/jesus-and-joseph-183351.jpg\"></p>\n<p>I imagine Joseph felt overwhelmed but that he also felt the love, trust, and confidence of Heavenly Parents as he accepted the solemn responsibility of being the earthly father of the Savior of the world. He was a real father in every way that I am a \"real dad.\"</p>\n<p>Or was he? And am I really?</p>\n<p>Sometimes when I get asked \"So, how much do they know about their real dad?\" I'm hit with the unintended but far more important meaning of that question. Because no matter how many diapers I've changed and skinned knees I've kissed and sleepless nights I've spent worrying about my children, they are not really mine. They are, and will always be, children of God first.</p>\n<p>If I do my job as a father right, I should be able to answer the question I so often get with confidence: \"They know a lot about Him. They pray to Him. They know that He loves them and has a plan for them and wants them to come home to live with Him again one day.\"</p>\n<p>So, welcome to the club---the amazing adoption club.</p>\n<p>You are adopted. You are a literal son or daughter of Heavenly Parents. They love you more than you can understand and want you to come back home to Them when your work here is done.</p>\n<p>And what makes a dad a real dad? It's not just making corny jokes, telling embarrassing stories, or even sharing the same DNA. It's being an example. It's teaching your children who they are and whose they are.</p>\n<p>I'm grateful for the opportunity I have to be a dad to three of Heavenly Father's children, and I'm trying my very best to be a real dad. As I work every day to love and teach my children, I'm being a real dad. And you know what? I'm okay with a small \"r\" on that word. I'll reserve the capital \"R\" for their Real Father---their Heavenly Father.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Derek Westra is a husband to one, father to three, and self-proclaimed donut enthusiast to hundreds.
