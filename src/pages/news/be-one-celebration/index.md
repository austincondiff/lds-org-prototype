The First Presidency has announced a special worldwide event to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the 1978 revelation on the priesthood and invites adults and children of all ages and backgrounds to watch the broadcast.

The live event is sold out.

"Be One" is the theme of the musical event, based on the Savior's admonition to "be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine" ([D&C 38:27](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.27?lang=eng#26)). It will feature messages from Church leaders and performances by Gladys Knight, Alex Boyé, the Bonner family, the Unity Gospel Choir International, and members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

## A monumental day

Forty years ago, on a truly monumental day in the history of the Church and the world, President Spencer W. Kimball announced that the opportunity to receive all the blessings of the priesthood would be extended to all of God's children everywhere in the world. The revelation rescinded the restriction on priesthood ordination. It also extended the blessings of the temple to all worthy Latter-day Saints, men and women (see [Official Declaration 2](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/2?lang=eng)).

While the June celebration will hail the history of black Mormon pioneers and reaffirm the reality that "all are alike unto God" ([2 Nephi 26:33](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33?lang=eng#32)) in His global family, the event is intended to be much more than a celebration. It will also be a renewal of our collective commitment to pursue oneness in our relationships with each other and with heaven.

Although attitudes and choices such as anger, bigotry, racism, prejudice, and intolerance cause separation and division, fortunately, prophets have taught that "a great day of unity is coming" ("[Our Hearts Knit as One](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/10/our-hearts-knit-as-one?lang=eng)," Oct. 2008 general conference).

President Russell M. Nelson and his wife, Wendy, are greeted by Latter-day Saints Mercy Makau and her family in Nairobi, Kenya, on his world tour, April 16, 2018.

President [M. Russell Ballard](https://www.lds.org/church/leader/m-russell-ballard?lang=eng) said, "We need to embrace God's children compassionately and eliminate any prejudice, including racism, sexism, and nationalism. Let it be said that we truly believe the blessings of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ are for every child of God" ("[The Trek Continues](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/the-trek-continues?lang=eng)!", Oct. 2017 general conference).

Added Elder [Quentin L. Cook](https://www.lds.org/church/leader/quentin-l-cook?lang=eng), "Anyone who claims superiority under the Father's plan because of characteristics like race, sex, nationality, language, or economic circumstances is morally wrong and does not understand the Lord's true purpose for all of our Father's children" ("[The Eternal Everyday](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/the-eternal-everyday?lang=eng)," Oct. 2017 general conference).
